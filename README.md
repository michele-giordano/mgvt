This repository hosts the core materials and code developed for the **Bachelor’s thesis** entitled **"Design and Development of an AI-based Virtual Teacher for Education"**, completed by the author in 2025 as part of a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer and Software Engineering.

## Overview

MGVT is an application that adopts the architectural principles of the MARE framework to implement an advanced AI-driven Virtual Teacher. It combines natural language processing, real-time speech synthesis, and 3D avatar rendering in a modular design.

This project also led to the creation of several specialized components, including:

- **Live functional demo**: A Unity3D application featuring real-time lipsync and a distributed asynchronous pipeline.
- [**VerbaManent**](https://github.com/michele-giordano/verbamanent): A customized fork of Coqui-TTS, restructured for improved modularity, phoneme alignment, and performance on consumer hardware.
- [**MARE framework**](https://github.com/michele-giordano/mare-framework): A modular evolution of the original RAEF architecture described in the author's thesis, built on virtual roles (Writer, Reviewer, Dubber, Courier) to optimize text-to-speech generation in educational scenarios.
